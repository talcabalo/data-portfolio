# Football Data Project – 2023/24 EPL

This project analyzes football player statistics for the 2023/24 Premier League season.  
It is a simple but professional example to demonstrate data analysis skills using Python and Pandas.

## Files
- `football_players_stats.csv` – dataset with player statistics (matches, goals, assists, passes).
- `football_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with analysis and visualizations.

## What’s inside
- Load and inspect the dataset with Pandas.
- Basic descriptive statistics.
- Identify top goal scorers.
- Simple bar chart visualization with Matplotlib.

## Next steps
- Add more advanced metrics (goals per 90, assists per 90).
- Extend analysis to team-level summaries.
- Build a Power BI dashboard from the dataset.
