## Projects  

### Football Data Project  
Using Python, SQL and Power BI to analyze football data (players, goals, matches).  
This project is still in progress, but the idea is to build dashboards that make the numbers easy to understand.

Analyzing macroeconomic data like GDP, inflation and unemployment with Python and Power BI.  
This project is planned for the next stage of my learning.
